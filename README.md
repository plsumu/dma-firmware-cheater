## Exposure of DMA Firmware Scammers

Please don't transfer money directly to buy DMA firmware. The scammer will ask you to pay $140 for the PRO version of the firmware. Before you pay the money, he will reply to your messages instantly. But after you've paid, he'll just keep you waiting and won't even reply to your messages anymore. What a shameless scammer!
Here is the address he uses on GitHub to deceive people and attract traffic:

https://github.com/peterlews/DMA-SCAN-PC

There is also another address used by scammers for attracting traffic:

https://github.com/JOKOSAHS/DMA-Pcileech-AX200

I'm not sure if it's the same person. Everyone must be on high alert and don't transfer money directly. Don't transfer money directly. Don't transfer money directly.

In addition, if you have encountered other scammers, please feel free to submit (Pull). In this way, we can help others avoid being cheated.
